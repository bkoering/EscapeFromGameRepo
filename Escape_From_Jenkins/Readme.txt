Escape From Old Man Jenkins
Brianne Koering


Game Goal
Get the plane and make it back to the start point before you lose all three lives. Old Man Jenkins 
and his dog Scruffy are going to be chasing you the whole time so avoid them. 


Old Man Jenkins and Scruffy begin at the brown mat with the house on it on the left. 
There is a countdown timer at the top right of the screen that starts at 30. When it hits
zero, Scruffy will begin chasing you. He is faster than Old Man Jenkins. 

Old Man Jenkins and Scruffy won't cross the water line. 

If you collide with Old Man Jenkins, Scruffy, a gnome or a cat you lose a life and go back to start. 


NOTE :::::::::::::::::::::
If you are colliding with two logs at once you will take on the velocity and DIRECTION of both. Which 
means you will stop moving all together. Manually move with the log at that point.
